# NLP_app
Using python, 
I built a sentiment analysis application capable of interpreting and classifying the emotion behind any sentence passed into the text field presented by the application.

I built the algorithm in a separate notebook and saved the weights of the model into a pickle file. 

This pickle file is loaded by the site and used at the backend to process incoming text samples. 

the model was trained using an Amazon reviews dataset.
